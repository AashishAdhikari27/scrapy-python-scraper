### Building the first scrapy spider


1) Create a scrapy project using the following command:

    --> scrapy startproject bookscraper
    replace bookscraper with your project name

2) Navigate to the project directory

3) Navigate to the spiders directory and write the folowing command :

    --> scrapy genspider bookspider books.toscrape.com

    It creates a new Scrapy spider named bookspider that is restricted to scraping only pages from books.toscrape.com.


    Breakdown of the command:

    --> scrapy genspider → Generates a new spider template.

    --> bookspider → The name of the spider.

    --> books.toscrape.com → The domain the spider is allowed to crawl.
